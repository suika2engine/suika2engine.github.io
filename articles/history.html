							<p>The history of Suika is a long one, created well before the introduction of Luxion, and to a greater extent, the Suika2 Development Team. Originally released to the public in December of 2001, Suika started out life as 'Suika Studio', a visual novel development tool that still used '西瓜Studio' as its unbranded name and featured a visual editor.</p>
							<p>Following the release of Ver.0.48 in March of 2003, the development of Suika Studio and its tools ended, and for more than ten years, the project as a whole saw no development or progress.</p>
							<p>However, in June of 2016, Suika was reborn, this time as 'Suika2', the 'Studio' branding being removed and the visual editor being scrapped completely.</p>
							<p>In June of 2022, Suika2 reintroduced a minimalist visual debugger that offered developers the ability to scrutinise and understand their scripts line-by-line as well as watch commands unfold in real-time.</p>
							<p>October of 2022 saw a major change in the structure of Suika2's development; with an increasing number of contributors and an ever expanding community, the decision was made to found the Suika2 Development Team who would act as the main circle of contributors and advisors regarding the project. The development of an updated and maintainable set of documentation was also a focus of this period, and notable leaps were made in regards to cross-platform homogeneity and language diversity.</p>
							<p>To be continued...</p>
