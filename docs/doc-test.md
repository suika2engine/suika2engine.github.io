And tables, like this:

| Heading 1 | Heading 2 |
|-----------|-----------|
| Item 1    | Item 2    |

Blockquotes are also rendered:

> We twa hae run about the braes,  
> and pou'd the gowans fine;  
> But we've wander'd mony a weary fit,  
> sin' auld lang syne.  
> – *Robert Burns*

Inline-code and callouts should also be displayed properly `with a thin border and light background`.
