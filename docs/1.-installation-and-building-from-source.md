# 1. Installation and Building from Source

From installation to game development, Suika2 is a simple click or build away.

## Binaries
Suika2 is available as a 'click-and-go' binary for both Windows and MacOS.

### Windows
* Download the ZIP file from the [official website](https://suika2.com/en/) and extract its contents.
* Open the extracted suika2 folder in Explorer.
* Run `suika.exe`.

### MacOS
* Download the ZIP file from the [official website](https://suika2.com/en/) and extract its contents.
* Open the extracted suika2 folder in Finder.
* Open `mac.dmg`
* Copy the `suika` application into the suika2 folder. (**Note:** Do not copy suika2 into the applications folder)
* Run `suika`.

## Building from Source
For Linux, IOS, and Android users, Suika2 is buildable from source.

Windows and MacOS users can also build from source if they so wish.

		* Copy `data01.arc` into `build/emscripten/html/`.
		* Run `make run`
* From a browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/html/`.
