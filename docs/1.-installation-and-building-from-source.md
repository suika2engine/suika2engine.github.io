# Binaries
Suika2 is available as a 'click-and-go' binary for both Windows and macOS devices.

## Windows
* Download the latest ZIP file provided on the [releases page](https://github.com/suika2engine/suika2/releases).
* Open the extracted suika2 folder in Explorer.
* Run `suika.exe`.

## macOS
* Download the latest ZIP file provided on the [releases page](https://github.com/suika2engine/suika2/releases).
* Open the extracted suika2 folder in Finder.
* Open `mac.dmg`.
* Copy the `suika` application into the suika2 folder. (**Note:** Do not copy suika2 into the applications folder.)
* Run `suika`.

# Building from Source
For Linux, IOS, and Android users, Suika2 is buildable from source. Windows and macOS users may also build from source if they would prefer.

## Windows Binary from source
This method will utilise a cross compiler to build a Windows binary.

* On Ubuntu 22.04 (WSL2 is acceptable), install the following packages:
	* `build-essential`
	* `mingw-w64`
* Alternatively, on MacOS 12, install `Homebrew` and the following package:
  * `mingw-w64`
* From the terminal, navigate to the `build/mingw` directory and run the following commands:
  * Run `./build-libs.sh` to build the libraries.
  * Run `make` to build `suika.exe`.
  * Run `make install` to copy `suika.exe` to the suika2 directory.
* Sign `suika.exe` with your own certificate if you require it.

To run Suika2, copy `suika.exe` to either the `game-en` or `game-jp` folder.

## macOS Binary from Source
This method will utilise Xcode to build a macOS binary.

* On macOS 12, install Xcode 13.
* From the terminal, navigate to the `build/macos` directory and run the following command:
  * Run `./build-libs.sh` to build the libraries.
* From Xcode, open `build/macos` and complete the following steps:
  * Set your development team.
  * Build the project.
  * Archive the project.
  * Notarize the application with the `Distribute App` button.
  * Select the `Export Notarized App` option to export the app to the suika2 folder.

**Note:** Projects will likely fail to build on Apple Intel machines, presenting the following errors:
* `'png.h' file not found`
* `Could not read serialized diagnostics file: error("Failed to open diagnostics file")`

Building from an Apple Silicon machine should alleviate these errors. However, if this is not viable, [download them here (starts download)](https://suika2.com/dl/libroot-mac.tar.gz).

To run Suika2, copy `suika` to either the `game-en` or `game-jp` folder.

## IOS
This method will utilise Xcode to build an IOS application.

* On macOS 12, install Xcode 13.
* From the terminal, navigate to the `build/ios` directory and run the following command:
  * Run `./build-libs.sh` to build the libraries.
* Alternatively, run `./build-libs-sim.sh` to build the libraries for use with simulators on Apple Silicon Mac.
* From Xcode, open `build/ios` and complete the following steps:
  * Navigate to the `Signing & Capabilities` tab and select `Automatically Manage Signing`.
  * Connect the IOS device via cable and build the project for the device.
  * Run the application from your IOS device.
  * Replace `build/ios/suika/data01.arc` with your own `data01.arc` file.

Run the application.

## Android
This method will utilise Android Studio to build an Android application.

* Install Android Studio.
* Navigate to `Tools –> SDK Manager –> SDK Tools` and complete the following steps:
  * Install `CMake (3.18.1)`
  * Install `NDK (24.0.8215888)`
* From the terminal, navigate to the `build/android` directory and run the following command:
  * Run `./prepare-libs.sh` to decompress the libraries.
* Open the Suika2 project from `build/android`.
* Build the project.

Run the application from your device or an emulator.

## Web
This method will utilise the Emscripten framework to build a web distribution.

* Prerequisites
  * Use a UNIX-like environment such as MSYS2, Linux, or macOS.
  * Ensure you can access `make` and `python`.
  * Install `Emscripten` using the `emc` command.
  * Generate a `data01.arc` using `suika-pro.exe`.
    * Using [Suika2 Pro for Creators](5.-suika2-pro-for-creators), select `File –> Export Package`.

* Instructions
  * From the terminal, navigate to the `build/emscripten` directory and run the following commands:
    * Run `make`
    * Copy `data01.arc` into `build/emscripten/html/`
    * Run `make run`
* From a browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/html/`.

## Release Files
This method will create a release-ready ZIP file.

* From the terminal, navigate to the `build/release` directory and complete the following steps:
  * Modify the `SIGNATURE` stored in the `Makefile` to sign the `.dmg` files.
  * Run `make` to create ZIP files.
  * Rename `suika-2.x.x-en.zip` and `suika-2.x.x-jp.zip` to the desired application names.
