# 5. Rules and Transitions
Rules are a transition type and follow a similar syntax to other effects in that they are arguments that are bound to their parent command.

## Calling Rule Transitions
Suika2 uses rule files stored in the `rule/` folder to render transitions. Rules are based on the [`@bg`](/docs/3.-suika2script-and-commands#bg) command and are appended as transitions with the `rule:` argument.

```
@bg image.png 1.0 rule:rule-name.png
```

**Note:** Rule files should be stored in the `.png` format.

## Creating Rule Transitions
It is recommended that developers use a graphics program that supports the `.png` format such as GIMP, Krita, or Photoshop to ensure properly encoded rule files. At their most basic, rule files are solid colors or patterns with a shape overlayed and filled with black (as well as it's derivative shades), this allows that specific section of the image to be see-through.

To try this for yourself, open a graphics program, set the background color, and draw in solid black. When you apply this rule, the areas previously drawn in black will appear transparent when rendered in-game. Try various lighter shades to see varying degrees of transparency.
