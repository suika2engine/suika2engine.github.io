								<h1>2.11.5 – 'The NVL Update'</h1>

							<p>Hi everyone, Kyo here. This evening I'm proud to announce Suika2.11.5 – 'The NVL Update' on behalf of the team. Although this update focuses on the implementation of the NVL style, there have been a number of improvement across the engine, so I hope you'll find this release note helpful.</p>
              <h2>Introducing NVL</h2>
							<p>As previously mentioned, this update focuses on the implementation of configurations and behaviour that allows for the simple creation of stories in the NVL style that is so loved for its nostelgic appereance – whenever I see NVL, no matter how modern the story, it takes me back to stories of the early 2000s such as Narcissu and Clannad (unfortunately, I can't recall which release uses NVL in the way I remember it).</p>
							<p>Some of the newly implemented features that can help in the creation of NVL-style stories include dimming previously read text, improved line breaking, choice text colour change, and a few other bits and pieces here and there. This update doesn't just introduce new abilities, it expands the usage-set of older features as well. Character text-colour, for example, is a rather popular feature of NVL stories. We've tested a fair few different NVL features, but we're sure you'll be able to find many many more during the creation process, so if you come up with anything interesting, please let us know!</p>
              <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
              <p>Every great project has its flaws, but this update rememdies most of Suika2's known or pervasive issues. Some of these fixes include: Mac video playback, video-flicker, broken line-breaks, some issues with OpenType fonts as well as a few other hickups. If you encounter any bugs or have any issues when switching over to Suika2.11.5, don't hesitate to contact us on Discord of via <a href="mailto:midori@suika2.com">e-mail</a>.*</p>
